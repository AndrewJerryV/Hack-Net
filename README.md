## Project Description

Students often struggle with creating tailored resumes for different job opportunities. Many submit generic resumes that are not optimized for the job description, leading to rejection by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) even before reaching recruiters. This AI-powered tool helps students instantly personalize their resumes based on specific job descriptions, improving match accuracy and increasing their chances of getting shortlisted.


## Use Case

Scenario: A college student is applying to multiple companies for internships or jobs. Each job has a slightly different requirement, but the student continues to use a single static resume.
Problem: Recruiters and ATS systems filter out resumes that don’t include relevant keywords or skills.
Solution: The Resume Customization AI allows students to:

Upload their base resume

Paste the job description

Automatically receive a tailored resume with suggestions, keyword highlights, and ATS optimization score

## Problem Statement

Students often submit one-size-fits-all resumes that do not align with specific job descriptions. Manually tailoring resumes for each application is time-consuming and tedious, and students are generally unaware of ATS (Applicant Tracking System) requirements.
